Few months ago, I created a blog right here which was powered by [Anchor CMS][anchor] - a very beautiful blogging platform.
It was cool and simple, but I wanted more control over how my blog works. So I removed Anchor CMS, and replaced it with [Jekyll][jekyll].
Jekyll is one of the coolest thing I've came across - easy to setup and you can host it on github for free!

The best thing about Jekyll is that you have full control over the working of your blog. Here's an excerpt from it's page:

> Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory containing raw text files in various formats, 
  runs it through Markdown (or Textile) and Liquid converters, and spits out a complete, 
  ready-to-publish static website suitable for serving with your favorite web server. Jekyll also happens 
  to be the engine behind GitHub Pages, which means you can use Jekyll to host your project’s page, blog, 
  or website from GitHub’s servers for free.

My blog is [hosted on Github][githubBlog], so you can see the source if you are just starting up and are in need of any help. 

I'll be using this blog to write about my experience in different projects I've done in the past or I'll do in the future. 
I haven't set up any RSS feed for this blog yet, so you can [follow me on twitter][twitter] for updates. I'm excited.
