I and [Rishabh][rishabhp] worked on a game for [Github GameOff 2012][gameoff] roughly a year ago and we named it Pappu Pakia.
We were fortunate enough to score the first place (along with four other winners) and get our hands on our first iOS device.

The game was pretty simple and was created using HTML5 Canvas. Everything was created from scratch (thanks to [Rezoner][rezoner]
for the music!)
